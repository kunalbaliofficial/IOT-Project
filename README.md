Temperature Sensor 

In this project I use Arduino Uno and ESP 8266 to collect the data from DH 22 sensor and then organise and send the data to the database.
After that the data is reorganised and sent to a website which visualizes the data.

Components 
--------------
1. Arduino Uno
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper Wires
4. Node MCU
5. LCD Screen 
6. Potentiometer

The code for Arduino Uno is in the above file.
